      Games played on three-in-a-row boards can be traced back to ancient Egypt,
      where such game boards have been found on roofing tiles dating from around
      1300 BC. An early variation of tic-tac-toe was played in the Roman Empire,
      around the first century BC. It was called terni lapilli and instead of
      having any number of pieces, each player had only three; thus, they had to
      move them around to empty spaces to keep playing.The game's grid markings
      have been found chalked all over Rome. Another closely related ancient
      game is three men's morris which is also played on a simple grid and
      requires three pieces in a row to finish, and Picaria, a game of the
      Puebloans. The different names of the game are more recent. The first
      print reference to "noughts and crosses", the British name, appeared in
      1858, in an issue of Notes and Queries. The first print reference to a
      game called "tick-tack-toe" occurred in 1884, but referred to "a
      children's game played on a slate, consisting of trying with the eyes shut
      to bring the pencil down on one of the numbers of a set, the number hit
      being scored"."Tic-tac-toe" may also derive from "tick-tack", the name of
      an old version of backgammon first described in 1558. The US renaming of
      "noughts and crosses" to "tic-tac-toe" occurred in the 20th century.In
      1952, OXO , developed by British computer scientist Sandy Douglas for the
      EDSAC computer at the University of Cambridge, became one of the first
      known video games. The computer player could play perfect games of
      tic-tac-toe against a human opponent.In 1975, tic-tac-toe was also used by
      MIT students to demonstrate the computational power of Tinkertoy elements.
      The Tinkertoy computer, made out of only Tinkertoys, is able to play
      tic-tac-toe perfectly. It is currently on display at the Museum of
      Science, Boston.
